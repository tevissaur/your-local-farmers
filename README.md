  ### Feature Requests
  
  We welcome feedback with or without pull requests. If you have an idea for how
  to improve the project, great! All we ask is that you take the time to write a
  clear and concise explanation of what need you are trying to solve. If you have
  thoughts on _how_ it can be solved, include those too!
  
  The best way to see a feature added, however, is to submit a pull request.
  
  ### Pull Requests
  
  - Before creating your pull request, it's usually worth asking if the code
    you're planning on writing will actually be considered for merging. You can
    do this by [opening an issue] and asking. It may also help give the
    maintainers context for when the time comes to review your code.
  
  - Ensure your [commit messages are well-written]. This can double as your
    pull request message, so it pays to take the time to write a clear message.
  
  - Add tests for your feature. You should be able to look at other tests for
    examples. If you're unsure, don't hesitate to [open an issue] and ask!
  
  - Submit your pull request!
  
  ### Support Requests
  
  For security reasons, any communication referencing support tickets for Coinbase
  products will be ignored. The request will have its content redacted and will
  be locked to prevent further discussion.
